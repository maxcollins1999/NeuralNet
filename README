## Synopsis

A basic neural network classifer built without the use of a machine learning library.

## Contents
README - README file.

ClassicalNet.py - The classic neural network class.

NumNet.py - The number neural network class that extends the classic neural network.

phom.py - A module of image processing functions.

save.txt - A save file of the number neural network weights.

test.py - A script to test the neural network against one of the images in Num Images

## Dependencies
